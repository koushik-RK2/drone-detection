# Advanced Drone Detection Project

## Introduction

The **Advanced Drone Detection Project** aims to provide an intelligent solution for detecting and tracking unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, in a wide range of environments. As drones become more integrated into both commercial and recreational activities, ensuring airspace security is essential. This project utilizes a combination of sensors, machine learning algorithms, and real-time data processing to detect, track, and classify drones in complex environments.

The goal of this project is to provide a robust and scalable system that can be used for various applications such as surveillance, airspace management, and security in both urban and rural settings.

## Overview

This project uses an integrated system of hardware and software to detect and track drones. It leverages state-of-the-art techniques such as radar, acoustic sensors, and camera-based vision systems to detect drones. The collected data is then processed and analyzed using advanced machine learning models for classification, tracking, and situational awareness.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Drone Detection:** Capture drone presence in real-time, utilizing various sensor data.
- **Tracking & Classification:** Track drone movement and classify them based on type, size, and behavior patterns.
- **Data Visualization:** Provide real-time dashboards for users to monitor drone activities.
- **Scalability:** The system is designed to scale for use in different environments, from small-scale operations to large, city-wide implementations.
- **Alerts & Notifications:** Automatic alerts are sent to users when a drone is detected within a defined perimeter.
